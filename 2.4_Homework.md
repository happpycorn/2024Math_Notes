## Exercise 1
Write an equation that expresses the fact that a function f is continuous at
the number 4.

## Exercise 4
if $\ a$ and $\ b$ are positive numbers, prove that the equation
$$\ \frac{a}{x^3+2x^2-1} + \frac{b}{x^3+x-2} = 0$$
has at least one solution in the innterval (-1, 1).

$\ \Rightarrow f(x) = \frac{a}{x^3+2x^2-1} + \frac{b}{x^3+x-2}$

$\ = \frac{a}{(x+1)(x^2+x-1)} + \frac{b}{(x-1)(x^2+x+2)}$
